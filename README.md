Dockerised freeswitch
=====================

Repository with [freeswitch](https://freeswitch.com), both Alpine Linux and
Debian versions, tiny as possible!

Regarding version tags for Alpine. We don't really know what freeswitch version
in the Alpine latest or edge at the moment of image re-creation, so tags for
Alpine latest and edge missing freeswitch version number. For past versions,
i.e. 3.9, it's included.
